# WINDSURF/CASCADE BEHAVIORAL RULES

1. NO PLACEHOLDERS: Never generate fake data, fake phones (555), or placeholder emails. If you lack a specific value (API key, email, URL), you must STOP and ask the user for it.

2. PRE-BUILD ANALYSIS: Before writing any code, you must:
   - Read the existing file context fully.
   - List potential regression risks (what might break).
   - Ask for clarification if dependencies are unclear.

3. CONSERVATIVE EDITING: Do not rewrite entire files if a partial edit suffices. Preserve existing comments and structure.

4. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: Always check `project_context.md` for variables. Do not hardcode strings.

5. ASK FIRST: If a request seems ambiguous, do not guess. Output: "I need clarification on [X] before proceeding."

6. CONTACT INFORMATION: Never create fake contact details. Always use real business information from project_context.md.

7. BUSINESS CRITICAL: Any information that could affect revenue, reputation, or client relationships must be verified with the user before implementation.

8. VERIFICATION PROTOCOL: Before claiming ANY operation success, must verify with multiple methods:
   - GitHub: Check `git ls-remote origin`, `git branch -r`, and repository URL directly
   - Never assume success from local operations or partial outputs
   - Always include error messages in responses
   - Cross-check at least 2 sources before status claims
   - If uncertain, state "I cannot verify this" rather than guessing

9. NO HALLUCINATIONS: Never claim results without verifiable evidence. If tool outputs are unclear or incomplete, state the limitation explicitly rather than filling gaps with assumptions.
